# CA2 on Predictive Modelling for Data Science module
Analyzing and dealing with the data related to "STROKE". Visualization and prediction of a person's age by implementing the multiple linear regression model with the variables present.

In this assessment, a predictive model is built which predicts the age of a person using multiple predictor variables from the stroke dataset. Since there are more than one predictor variable, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) technique is used for analyzing and building the predictive model
